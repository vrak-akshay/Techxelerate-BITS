## AI-Powered Traffic Signal Optimization


# Project Overview
Traffic congestion causes delays, pollution, and inefficiency due to fixed signal timings. This project leverages AI & real-time traffic data to dynamically optimize signal timings, improving traffic flow, reducing wait times, and enhancing urban mobility.

# Features
-  Real-time Traffic Analysis – Uses live traffic data from sensors, cameras.
-  AI-Based Signal Optimization – Dynamically adjusts signals based on congestion.
-  Traffic Flow Prediction – Uses Machine Learning to forecast traffic trends.
-  Interactive Dashboard – Visualizes traffic data and AI decisions.

# Tech Stack
- Modules Used : Pytorch, numpy, CV2.
- Models Used : Yolo Model, Q learning model.
